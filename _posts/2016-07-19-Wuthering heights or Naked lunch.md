title: Wuthering heights or naked lunch

## Introduction

Let's cut the technical sweetness with some literature crazy. Recently, i wanted to break out of the funk of picking up my next book from the top charts and succumbed
to my innnate human craving for the controversial, couple that with my longing for something 'old', sorry,
'classic' i zeroed in on picking up wuthering heights. A comment by a contemporary nudged me over
the contemplation phase to dive in head first.

A fiend of a book – an incredible monster. The action is laid in hell, – only it seems places and people have English names there

Took me a good few months to get through the book, the first thing i noticed myself doing is tapping my kindle to know what the
words meant, its a fantastic vocabulary builder. The next is that i hit the last page, with my thirst for the fiend going
un quenched. Ok, Heathcliff loves catherine, is bitter about her choice, he acts out a bit. Isnt this the age old cant live with you
cantcant live without you? i was expecting heathcliff to ride into thrushcross grange and do the unthinkable. I guess our
bar for evil has inflated more than any world currency over the last couple hundred years, wait hold that thought.

Enter Naked lunch..

I got a huge man crush on Anthony Bourdain and will likely make him uncomfortable one of these days i plan on getting him to sign an
autograph, location discreet. On his trip to tangier, he brought up naked lunch and william s burroughs. He killed his wife, was
homosexual, junkie and was from a suburban family, i'd say he is a five tool player of authors. The best way i can think of to
describe naked lunch is that burroughs pissed on people and told them it was raining, they thanked him and the weather gods. Its
a revulsive cocktail of devious sex, human excreta and everything else that would get ur dinner reversing its course, but then
isnt authoring judged by the potency of reception?
